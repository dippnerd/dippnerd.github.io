Since iOS can natively only handle a single timer at a time, I’ve frequently found myself frustrated when I need more than one. While the App Store does contain some apps that can create multiple timers, they’re all missing one crucial feature:  Siri control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where Just Timers comes in, with the ability to use the iOS 12 feature “Siri Shortcuts” to assign your own voice phrases to timer actions like pause, resume and restart. While this is intended as the primary method of interacting with your timers, I’ve also extended the abilities into the iOS app &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8&quot;&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;, which provides automation features for iOS. There is an extensive write up available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://justtimers.app/help/shortcuts/&quot;&gt;Just Timers website&lt;/a&gt; which goes into detail on what commands are supported by the API, but long story short you can do everything Siri Shortcuts can and more. With a downloadable Shortcut available on that page, you can even create new timers completely hands free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-timers/id1453573845?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Just Timers&lt;/a&gt; and give me some feedback if you can!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><summary type="html">Today I’ve launched my first iOS app, Just Timers.

The Belkin Thunderbolt 2 Express HD Dock attempts to be a lot crammed into a relatively small package. At the time of me writing this, it’s been out for a few years and is priced pretty much on par with the other options like it. The nice thing about buying it now, however, is you can pick them up used for a good bit cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main appeal of this device is it can connect 8 different devices over one Thunderbolt 2 cable, with the option to further daisy-chain additional Thunderbolt devices. It comes with three USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, HDMI, Ethernet and two audio out ports (one includes mic support). For me, the main appeal was a way to consolidate the mess of wires I had plugged into my laptop for my particular needs. Prior to this dock, I had: an Ethernet adapter plugged in over Thunderbolt, a wired keyboard and trackpad (the trackpad wasn’t required to stay plugged in, it’s just a preference of mine), wired external speakers, HDMI out and of course power. Thanks to this dock, I am now down to just a single Thunderbolt 2 cable and a power cable. I’d certainly prefer this to be one wire, but it’s vastly superior to how I was doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason I wanted to move to this solution was because I was finding myself rarely using my laptop outside of my desk, solely because it was such a hassle to remove all of these cables. Sure, I could have a wireless keyboard and trackpad, wireless speakers, and even ditch the Ethernet, but my gigabit network speeds are many times faster than my wifi, I already own the wired keyboard that I like, and I don’t like wireless speakers (they’re usually Bluetooth and lossy/flaky at best). Keeping things how I prefer, I never have to deal with charging my trackpad or pairing to the speakers, instead, this dock allows me the comfort of all of these preferences through one cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough of the why, the real question is how well does this thing work? First off, it should be noted that I did buy this used on Amazon, so there is always a chance that any problems I have with it may be due to that. I was leery when reading reviews on all of the docks of this sort available, as they often had similar complaints regarding issues with HDMI or Ethernet in particular. A few claimed their Ethernet speeds were 100mbit/s instead of the advertised gigabit, which was concerning, as it would make my whole reason for this device a bit less necessary if my wifi speeds are better than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only had this dock a few days, but overall, so far so good. I tested Ethernet speeds between the official Apple dongle and this dock, and they are generally comparable, a few times the dock even outperforms the dongle. So far, no issues with HDMI either. In the past I’ve had occasions were HDMI directly from the HDMI port on my laptop gave me trouble, but nothing of the sort &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. My keyboard and trackpad are plugged in and working fine (though I previously had my trackpad plugged into one of the USB ports of my keyboard, once using the dock this resulted in a message about power every time I connected to the dock so I just moved the trackpad to charge directly from the dock, no more message). The only real complaints I have so far are with the speaker connection (and this is largely my own fault for having a particularly quirky setup).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a set of desktop speakers connected to a desktop computer, then a cable that runs from the line in on that computer to the dock (previously to my laptop). Since moving to the dock, I have noticed a slight feedback hum over my speakers, but immediately rearranged some wires and found the power cable was causing the majority of the noise. Moving it away helped, but hasn’t completely fixed it. There may be some other fix, but for now I’ve minimized it enough to not care. The only other complaint, and this really doesn’t affect me directly, is how hot the dock gets while in use. I realize I’m nearly maxing out it’s ports, but it gets surprisingly warm driving my 4K monitor (which is advertises it can do). I don’t know that this is the culprit, but it makes the most sense given how low-bandwidth the rest of the connections are. While my Ethernet can do gigabit, the dock still gets warm while idle and driving my display. If the display goes to sleep, however, the dock does cool down, so that seems to be the common factor. Again, this really doesn’t impact me overall, as it still works and I rarely need to touch it (nor is it too hot to touch, just warmer than I’d like). This could cause some longterm problems, but I guess time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should add, one of the main reasons I picked this dock over a few other options I was considering was largely because it has the USB port and audio jack (with mic) on the front, as well as the ones on the back. This is minor for most people, but since I have the desktop speakers plugged in on the back, I wanted something I could still easily plug in headphones and other USB peripherals into as needed. If these aren’t needful things for you, the other docks may suffice (but I can’t vouch for them). For me, this seems like a winner.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><summary type="html">This is very late to the game, but since there has been a slight resurgence in demand for 2015 Macbook Pro’s of late, I figured it might not hurt to give a short review on this unit.

Back when Apple acquired the company behind Workflow, a powerful automation tool for iOS, there was much speculation on just what would happen. Many feared it would disappear, never to be seen again, but over time we still saw bug fix updates come to the Workflow app. At WWDC they showed off Siri Shortcuts, and an app called Shorcuts that will coincide with this. It is very clear that this Shortcuts app is the result of the Workflow acquisition. The layout is almost identical, but the key difference this time around is that it is much more deeply integrated with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shortcuts app itself would be pretty handy in general, you’ll be able to build Automator-style “Shortcuts” that can trigger actions throughout the OS. Apple showed that third-parties will also be able to integrate with this, so the benefits begin to snowball into something very interesting. Apple didn’t stop there, however. Combine all of this with the “Siri” side of things:  Shortcuts will be able to trigger using custom voice phrases that the user can assign for Siri. Telling Siri “laundry time” could kick off a custom Shortcut that the user created, for example. The icing on the cake with all of this is that, beyond just voice, Siri will recognize patterns in usage for these Shortcuts and offer recommendations for them throughout the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of Siri recommendations include Spotlight/Siri search, where the user can pull down on the home screen and it will present some suggested shortcuts based on relevant context (time, location, etc). Running late for a meeting? It may offer to text your boss. Going to the gym? It may recognize a gym Shortcut you setup to start a workout and listen to a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recommendations can also be helped along by third-party apps. These apps can “donate” Siri relevant data for it to analyze and find patterns with. Apple offers various ways to “nudge” Siri in the right direction if you know you want the user to see this information within certain times, events, etc, but overall it sounds like it should be pretty capable of learning and offering useful suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other ways these Shortcuts will come up include the lock screen and the Siri watch face for Apple watch. This is particularly exciting, as it will be possible for many tasks to be carried off in the background, the user simply needs to invoke it from the watch face or trigger phrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these details are still unclear, these Siri Shortcuts offer a huge leap in capabilities for Siri. What used to be a fairly limited set of SiriKit domains will not be opened pretty wide for third-parties to do as they please. It hasn’t been made clear if apps will be able to request additional information, such as asking the user for input without opening the app, but if this isn’t available at launch, surely it won’t be far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these trigger phrases will be programmed by the user, it sounds like they won’t be fine-grained enough to accept variable inputs. While it would be awesome to, for example, be able to say “order 2 pizzas” and have it parse each word to understand quantity and product, the reality sounds like it will be closer to “order pizza” and the app will guide you through the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One curiosity I’m anxious to see is how all of this fits into the Shorcuts app. Workflow the app is capable of requesting user input for variables, but what if this went a step further and allowed Siri to not only trigger by the phrase, in this case “order pizza”, but could also ask follow-up questions like “what toppings?”, “what size?” and “how many?”. These will be more difficult of course, and likely won’t be available immediately, but it would really complete the autonomous nature that this concept is creating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Google showed off an AI feature that attempted to mimic a human being calling over the phone for use as their assistant. It was intended to set appointments and things of that nature, but ultimately came off a little too uncanny and creepy for a lot of people. While the idea is neat, it takes much of the human/AI grey area too far. What Apple could accomplish with these new functions is an alternative option to Google’s AI: A way for the user to quickly and effortlessly accomplish the same tasks, but without the creepy phone call to somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen Apple’s ability to integrate with ride sharing and restaurant booking via Siri. No phone calls are needed, but the user can quickly request what is needed and get a result. Shortcuts has the potential to take this to the next level and allow third-parties to develop their own options for booking appointments, ordering food, etc. While this will depend on the companies to build support, it would allow a clear separation of that uncanny valley and allow the same work to be done. This also leaves far less room for error, as a properly developed app would be able to know what problems they may run into, rather than an AI that hopefully is able to respond when confronted with an unexpected human question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Siri Shortcuts are still in early days. We haven’t even seen the full Shortcuts app yet, so it’s hard to know just where the separation from Workflow to Shortcuts exists. The fact that we have any integration with iOS is a huge leap forward, let alone the fact that third-party apps will be able to tie into not only the Shortcuts app, but Siri voice triggers and the various suggestions throughout the ecosystem. These will all continue to evolve into something much more complex that everyone can benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><category term="apple" /><category term="wwdc" /><category term="siri" /><summary type="html">At WWDC this week, Apple announced a huge milestone for Siri: Siri Shortcuts.

While rumors leading up to this event were pretty sparse, the overall tone was that this would be a bug fix year more than a feature-heavy one. Right off the bat they made it clear there would be no hardware announcements, this was all about software. They dove right in to explaining that they were doing a lot to improve performance and stability (Apple’s way of saying “bug fixes”) and even pointed out that these gains alone would make for a great year (roll credits, show is over), but they didn’t stop there. Over the next two hours they went on to explain a plethora of features that were widely unexpected for this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bit too much to cover here, so I’ll try to tackle a few favorites (though I’m sure I’ll still forget some of those!). For me, the biggest surprise and my favorite announcement was the Siri Shorcuts. This is a combination of a few things, but a lot of it ties into the Shortcuts app that will be coming out for iOS 12. This appears to be the result of Apple’s acquisition of the Workflow app and team, as it strongly resembles it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectively, Shortcuts allows the user to create their own “scripts” to run various actions, and by being integrated into iOS now, it looks like they’ll provide even more fine-grained ways to work with this than before. By itself this would be a pretty neat feature, but on top of this, users will be able to assign voice triggers for both the shortcuts they create as well as first and third-party apps that have their own functions. This opens a lot of possibilities up for using Siri, as you can create your own memorable trigger phrases to take whatever actions you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going yet another step further, voice isn’t the only way a user is required to trigger these shortcuts. The machine learning side of Siri will also be able to recognize patterns in usage and suggest shortcuts to the user in a variety of ways, ranging from Spotlight, the lock screen, even the Siri watch face on the Apple Watch. If a user does a particular action every day at the same time, or location, etc, Siri can recommend this shortcut to the user, allowing them to bypass what would otherwise be a lot of manual steps. As this evolves, this has the potential to be a complete game changer in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with shortcuts showing up on the watch, third parties will be able to integrate with the Siri watch face now as well. This was something everyone has wanted since the watch face was announced last year, so it seems obvious, but none the less this is a great addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The watch is also getting both a native podcasts app as well as support for third party background audio, meaning third party podcasts apps as well. I use Overcast for podcasts, but the developer of it, Marco Arment, has long been unsatisfied with the options available to make a proper watch app. it sounds like Apple has listened, as he is already planning some big updates for Overcast which is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on the watch is a feature that was supposed to show up in the first generation of the watch and quietly disappeared by launch, walkie-talkie. I’m not sure what the reason for the delay was, but either way, it’s here now and looks like it should be a pretty handy feature. While I can’t see myself using it all of the time, it could be handy when you just need a quick message, be it to someone across the house, or for quick confirmation if you’re out somewhere. We’ll see how my usage of it evolves once it comes out, but I’m excited to see what it’s like either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something really interesting coming to the watch is the ability to invoke Siri without using “hey Siri”. They claim it will respond simply by you raising your wrist and speaking the command. They seem pretty confident that it won’t trigger accidentally, but we’ll see how that plays out. This has a lot of potential to be useful, but I’m still a bit skeptical just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice update coming to both the watch and iOS are notifications. People have long complained about notifications lacking a way to group them, so finally that request has been heard. Not only can notifications be grouped, but iOS will also allow you to easily tweak notification settings from from each one. You’ll be able to have them silently go straight to notification center instead of pinging you, which is really useful. Siri will also be able to suggest changes to the notifications, presumably based on how much you do or don’t interact with them. Do Not Disturb mode is also being enhanced so you don’t need to disable notifications entirely, but rather can just turn on DND for an hour, or have it turn off when you leave a location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting feature for the watch is Student ID cards. It’s not clear if this will branch out to more sooner than later, but it seems users will not need a full blown ID badge around college campuses. Rather, their watch will be able to work as their ID and the NFC capabilities of the watch will be able to work with readers to authenticate students, pay for snacks, laundry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough about watchOS though (that could be a post of its own!), iOS is getting some big changes that I love too. Group FaceTime will finally be a thing, supporting up to 32 users! They have a pretty nice UI for it that isn’t as jarring as most that I’ve used seem to be. Users will be able to hop in and out on demand like a chat room, which is pretty useful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple also demoed some new ARkit functionality, using LEGOs in a way that brought them to life. I’m a little conflicted on this, as half of the fun for me with LEGOs has always been interacting with them using my imagination, but their presentation does present it more as a way to extend the fun. Either way, they’re making some huge strides in ARkit, especially only being a year old. It’s clear they’re laying down a foundation for something huge further down the road, as in, glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, another one of my favorites include the performance improvements they started off with. When it was announced, I was skeptical that we’d even notice a difference here. After loading the beta up on my iPad Air 2 (now nearly 4 years old and sluggish), it’s not just that it feels like a new device, but the perceived performance enhancements almost seem faster than it was on day one. Not only do I get more life out of this aging device, it’s even better than ever! I’m excited to see how this works across my other devices, as users have reported the same improvements across iPhone and watchOS, which is very promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, while there’s always room for improvement, I think this was a very promising WWDC. It was filled with way more than most of us were expecting, and lays down a foundation for bigger things in the coming years. I’m pretty excited to see how things unfold, but it seems like the betas are incredibly fast and stable already, so that’s a great start. Perhaps we’ll be in for something huge in the fall?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><category term="apple" /><category term="wwdc" /><category term="ios" /><category term="watchos" /><category term="siri" /><summary type="html">Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) for 2018 is underway, and to kick things off they had their announcements on Monday, June 4th.

This disappeared in the latest beta, but it has since sparked some interest in using AirPort Expresses for AirPlay speakers, so I thought I’d take some time to write about how I use these devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has offered some method of audio streaming to AirPort Expresses for years now, updating the AirPlay protocol along the way. The concept is great, you have a puck that both acts as a wireless router (or extender) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; can stream music over a 3.5mm audio jack. Because it uses this universal standard, you can plug any of your own speakers into it and “magically” have wireless audio anywhere in your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t need the wireless router part? No problem! You can disable wireless altogether if you want to just play music using an ethernet cable, or you can even just let the device work in client mode, where it connects to your wireless router like any other device. Either configuration works great from my experience, I’ve played with a mixture of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have multiple AirPort Expresses throughout my house used solely for wireless audio, which works out great as I have a bunch of existing amps and speakers to attach them to. One big reason people (myself included) hope to see these devices get updated to AirPlay 2 is because AirPlay 1.x has some very specific limitations. The most noticeable is how there is always a 2-second delay between play/pause for audio while it buffers. When AirPlay first came out, it was so revolutionary that it was easy to overlook this delay, but in recent years competition in this space has grown, making this delay quite annoying. Another limitation is that you can only play music from an iOS device to one AirPlay source at a time. Note I said iOS device, the exceptions here are that iTunes on macOS can play to multiple simultaneously (and even seems to handle the delay issue a bit better) as well as third party apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/&quot;&gt;Airfoil by Rogue Amoeba&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give my house the effect of whole-home audio from any device, I’ve had to get a bit creative. While I could just always play music from iTunes on my Mac using the Remote app, it’s outdated and fairly clunky these days. Instead, I want to be able to use any app on any device to stream to every AirPlay speaker at the same time. Thankfully, Rogue Amoeba also makes an app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/#satellite&quot;&gt;Airfoil Satellite&lt;/a&gt; for macOS which allows you to stream to your Mac as though it were an AirPlay source. Configuring Airfoil to take the system audio as the source, now I can AirPlay from any device that supports AirPlay and it will transmit that audio to the AirPlay speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Airfoil I can solve at least one issue with AirPlay 1, playing to multiple sources, but in the default state this is even a bit clunky. Unless you leave the speakers connected to Airfoil all the time (I often want to just play directly to one speaker), you have to open the Airfoil app and select which speakers to play to. This is where software like Homebridge comes in handy. I have a write-up over on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dippnerd/airfoil-speakers-applescript&quot;&gt;GitHub project&lt;/a&gt; explaining all of the settings I used, but essentially I have scripts tied to a fake lightbulb so HomeKit lets me toggle on/off as well as volume (using the brightness slider). This gives me way more control and flexibility without having to go into an app to turn on the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the page I also mention another project I’ve been working on, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dippnerd/applescript-flash-briefing&quot;&gt;Flash Briefing&lt;/a&gt; of sorts. There is a fairly deep explanation on that page, but suffice it to say I use this same AirPlay speaker and Airfoil combination to broadcast a flash briefing throughout the entire house each morning. This includes things like weather, calendar events, birthdays, news, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the right effort, I suspect you could fully extend this functionality to really do a lot over the speakers, including using it as a quasi-doorbell (but the 2-second delay may be a problem) or other automation triggers like telling you when the mail has arrived, or announcing when dinner is ready. If I ever get around to hard-wiring all of my speakers to talk to one central amp, one could just pipe audio directly out of the Mac instead of over AirPlay, saving that just for times when you wish to stream from a device like your phone, but one thing at a time :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><summary type="html">A few weeks back it was discovered in an iOS beta that AirPort Express devices were showing up as speakers in the Home app, implying Apple might be updating these devices to support AirPlay 2.

As a speaker, HomePod is fantastic device not just for sound, but for ease of use too. It’s going to be hard to find something that has such omni-directional, quality sound. The size of the HomePod is particularly impressive for what all it accomplishes. Best of all, the complete ease of use (especially compared to the traditional amp and speaker setup that may scare some users away) makes it as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that said, while HomePod is a great speaker, it just isn’t ready for my home yet. While Apple by no means lied about what functionality would come with it out of the box, some of the promised features like AirPlay 2 and Stereo Pairing (both announced at WWDC in June) are still missing. On top of that, there was a lot of mystery around what Siri would or wouldn’t do at launch. It wasn’t until I started reading reviews and eventually tried it out myself that I got to see how broken it is compared to Siri on virtually every other device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand, I’m not by any means trying to say Siri is bad. I love it across most of my devices, and have &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/10/07/in-defense-of-voice-assistants/&quot;&gt;outlined its many uses&lt;/a&gt; to me in the past. The Siri on HomePod, however, is crippled. No matter how you want to look at it, Siri on HomePod is lacking in a lot of ways that other Apple devices already can handle. A big issue for me was voice detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siri on my iOS devices is trained to my voice, meaning if someone else in my house utters “Hey Siri,” my phone won’t pick up the request. HomePod has the same A8 chip as an iPhone 6, which is capable of the always-on “Hey Siri” (if the phone is plugged in). HomePod should be able to at least offer voice training, but to go a step further, it shouldn’t be too hard to still allow untrained voices to access music, but not my reminders and messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While HomePod is a great speaker, for me personally, I already have some speakers I’m happy with. Sure, they don’t have the omni-directional, room-filling capabilities of the HomePod, but on the grand scale, that’s not something I need just yet (especially not for the money, considering I already have speakers). All I’m really looking for is a device not unlike the Amazon Echo Dot, but with Siri, to plug into my existing speakers. Apple may not be making such a device anytime soon (if ever), but that would be my ideal scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, I certainly won’t say I’ll never buy a HomePod. As I said before, it is perfect for a specific market of people who don’t want to hassle with getting great sound. I still fit that market, but HomePod is going to need to do a bit more to win me back. I need AirPlay 2 and Stereo Pairing to get here, along with improvements to Siri. I’d love to see a price drop as well (though it does pack a lot into a small space for the money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I don’t want to buy a HomePod based on future promises/expectations. Things I expect from HomePod may not be in Apple’s plan, and for that I don’t want to assume that will change. Instead, I’ll wait to see how HomePod plays out. I’d imagine like most of Apple’s products, the first generation keeps things very simple, while the second or third generation (be it software or hardware) tends to really sell the product. HomePod’s hardware shouldn’t need too many refreshes that often, so hopefully we’ll see some big software updates before too long to get me to try it again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><summary type="html">I purchased the HomePod nearly two weeks ago, and today it went back to Apple.

My interest was more on Siri than the speaker/music aspect of it, but I understand their positioning in such a space, they need to be premium. Pre-orders came and went without me, I decided I wanted to hear some reviews from actual people instead of media outlets before deciding. As expected, early reviews as folks unboxed their units were very positive for the sound, but a bit underwhelmed by Siri. The sound has been the big seller for this device, so of course I would hope it would be good, but as more and more folks compared it to fancier speakers, the more interested I became.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided it was worth at least trying one out during Apple’s return window and see where I land. I picked one up from the local mall and plugged it in over my mantel. At first I was pretty unimpressed, the sound seemed good, but not amazing. I did quickly realize we were mostly playing music from the ’60s, like the Beatles, which may not have been recorded to really show this thing off. Next we queued up some modern pop songs with a mix of highs, mids and lows to really demo the range. This is definitely where the HomePod shines. It’s not like older music is bad on it, but I realized there is only so much you’ll be able to differentiate from older recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that day we tried AirPlaying the Apple TV audio to the HomePod to see how well it works as a sound bar of sorts. It works, with somehow less delay than my other AirPlay speakers even (there is typically a 2-second delay between pressing pause/play and the actual result, but they all stay in sync otherwise). It is more quiet than music on the same device, but it still showed me how much we’ve been lacking from the standard TV speakers. This is something that a proper sound system would probably be equally impressive with, but having none of that, it’s nice to have one device solve multiple problems. There’s a lot of potential for this to be the perfect solution for us when two HomePods can be paired together in stereo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I had a chance to sit down with it on the evening of the second day and properly compare it to my existing stereo system that I would say is probably the “best” in the house. It’s a custom system I pieced together, consisting of a standalone amp attached to some decent bookshelf speakers and an AirPort Express providing AirPlay input to the amp. While my tests weren’t super thought out, I tried to place the speakers and HomePod in ways that wouldn’t get in each other’s ways but still provide a good test for their typical usage. They say the HomePod needs to play music for a little while to calibrate itself after it’s been moved, so perhaps that explains things, but at first I was a little disappointed. While HomePod was better, it didn’t seem like by much. It certainly fills a room better, anywhere you walk the sound is pretty consistent, but sitting in front of both, the sound seemed only marginally better. I decided to put on an Apple Music playlist, hoping it would have some songs just for this purpose. It wasn’t until the song “Fitzpleasure” by alt-J came on that the difference became incredibly clear. The range on the song really set things apart and made my old system sound hollow and tinny. I hate to use the comparison, but it really was similar to going from a standard display to retina. Hearing the difference, it’s hard to go back to the other&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#one&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One observation I’ve made about this speaker is how it automatically tunes itself for each song. This is something in the past I would have had to do pretty regularly either on my amp directly or via a software equalizer, and is something I really don’t care to interact with. I realize that’s the least audiophile thing to say, but I’m no audiophile 🙂 I think I pretty well sum up the market this device is for, average consumers who just want music to sound good without any extra effort. I don’t want to mess with speaker placement, tucking wires or messing with equalizers. I just want a device I can plug in and have results that work as expected without any tweaking. HomePod definitely does great at that, and not just because it learns your room, but in general because it has a lot of engineering in the DSP to really make a lot happen from a small device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to music, HomePod is a winner. It has reminded me of why I ever invested in a decent sound system to start with, not to mention my collection of vinyls. It wasn’t about sound quality as much as just the experience of sitting and actively listening to music instead of passively while doing something else. HomePod makes me want to sit and enjoy music with friends in a way I haven’t in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HomePod is marketed at having “room filling sound”. The concept seems pretty simple, it just needs to make the room have sound from anywhere. This is actually a pretty tough trick typically, since most stereo systems use two speakers pointed forward. You’ll hear music outside of there, but it tends to very quickly lose its quality as you veer from being directly in front. HomePod has a circular array of tweeters, and using their fancy software and processor, they can adjust the sound based on the room dynamics. This means, typically, anywhere I went in the room after it adjusted itself (which happens during the first song you play) the sound was the same. It’s one of those things you kind of have to experience to really feel it, but it transforms the way you listen to music in a lot of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond all of that, there is of course the Siri functionality. I will definitely say that personally, I’ve been using Siri since my iPhone 4S which I got a few weeks after launch. It has been something I find incredible value in, and the evolution of features over time has only increased that value for me. I know plenty of people like to trash talk it, say it doesn’t work, or that it is “light years behind &amp;lt;Alexa/Google Assistant&amp;gt;”. While this debate is best saved for another time, overall my experience on the iPhone with Siri has been pretty much on par with Google Assistant and in most cases&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#two&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; far surpasses Alexa. Notice I said on iPhone though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HomePod Siri unfortunately comes out of the gate crippled a bit more than its iOS version. While 95% of my queries have been fine, there have been a few times where it simply says “I can’t do that on HomePod” or similar, even for something simple like weight conversions. It tended to work after I adjusted the wording slightly, but that’s still unfortunate. They market this device as being a musicologist, and thusly, Siri is ideal for music requests. This has been overall a great success, but I have had it hiccup on requests like “Who’s the drummer in this?” for bands where the answer is obvious, such as the Beatles. It was a more obscure song, but it should still be able to get that data regardless of what is attached to each song. However, this really was only a problem for that song, overall it’s been able to tell me all sorts of random facts about the music, from who plays what, to who wrote the specific song in bands like the Beatles where it regularly alternates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quirky aspect of HomePod with regards to Siri is Apple’s approach to tying in things like messages and reminders. HomePod allows you to set reminders or send messages with Siri, but only if you give permission to, because unfortunately they don’t do any type of voice detection to ensure the wrong user isn’t attempting to read/send messages. This also means these services are only tied to one user for now, but I imagine all of this will change with an update in the near future. Ideally they will provide multiple voice detection (Google already can, and Siri can on iOS) that can tie to each user’s profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting approach they took was forcing these interactions to occur on the user’s phone. Basically, it detects the request and passes it to the phone for processing. This also aids in a kind of security, as these interactions can only occur when the user is on the same wifi. At least this way no one will be reading your messages if you’re not home. I don’t now if they plan to keep this design, but I do kind of like it from an engineering aspect. By separating this out, in theory it only needs to store data about who’s phone to send to, so potentially as they add support for more users, it could simply know how to route to the user’s phone and do the rest. This keeps things secure and private in some ways, but it’s not like there’s much one could extract from HomePod either way. I also could see this being a way they allow users to authorize interactions, using Touch/Face ID when needed, since it all interacts with the phone anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;one&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
One of the most impressive parts of the Siri experience on HomePod is how well it can hear you, regardless of how loud music may be. I’ve done multiple tests with volume at 100% and am still able to make requests to Siri at what I would consider a normal speaking volume. You certainly won’t be whispering at 100% volume, but I think you can still talk slightly quieter than if you were talking to someone else in the same room at that volume. At 60% you can easily talk lower than regular speaking volume and Siri will hear you perfectly. I haven’t had any mistakes in what it heard me request so far either, which is a common issue people complain about on iOS. Clearly this thing benefits a ton from having always-on power and an array of mics. The internal processing it does with all of the sound definitely helps it pick up these sounds over the other noise, which is super useful for play/pause commands.
&lt;a name=&quot;two&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; As a follow up, I did end up doing some further tuning and concluded that my existing setup is a lot better than I thought initially. The HomePod still does better at the “room filling” aspect, as mine requires sitting in the “sweet spot”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; Alexa does have tons of “skills”, but I’ve never known anyone who uses these are more than a party trick, and most of them are clunky even for that. There are going to be a few things each assistant does better than the other, with Alexa’s multiple timers being better than Siri’s single timer, but I’ve learned tricks like using alarms and reminders to solve that ages ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><category term="apple" /><category term="homepod" /><category term="siri" /><category term="airplay" /><category term="smart-speaker" /><summary type="html">When Apple announced the HomePod and it’s price of $349, I was a little put off, hoping for something cheaper that would allow me to plug into my existing speakers.

Amazon in particular has grown a very large set of “skills” by allowing anyone to interface with it in some way. While these skills offer some additional functionality, they don’t offer a lot of tangible value for most users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2016/people-using-amazon-echo-new-study-reveals-surprising-patterns/&quot;&gt;Recent statistics suggest&lt;/a&gt; the majority of users are only using these assistants to set timers, play music and read the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to setting timers, playing music and reading the news, this is something most assistants already can do. Some other items on that list included smart home control and adding items to shopping lists, and while Amazon hopes to make money off of the shopping list side of things, this functionality may just as easily be a reminders list instead of actually buying through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alexa skill set is vast, but as noted, not terribly useful for a lot of people. Some of this comes down to the difficult phrasing required to trigger them. Alexa treats voice more like a command line than an actual assistant who you can speak to naturally. This can frustrate users and ultimately lead to them not using a lot of the potential. One challenge here is that not only does Alexa not do the best job at natural language parsing to trigger skills, but these skills also don’t have an easy job for handling things from there. Any natural language parsing has to be programmed by the developer of the skill, which can end up giving a very inconsistent experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I don’t think Amazon expects to make huge waves with their skills, but they definitely need to rethink some of the design in order to keep their leg up in this space. While Apple’s Siri is often ridiculed for a lack of such skills, their SiriKit Domains approach actually works very well. It does limit things to just a handful of domains, but these domains require very little effort from the developer and provide a natural language parser that works very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voice assistant space is still very young, and while Amazon has a lead in a lot of areas, I don’t think skills are really one we can boast as making them leaders. Alexa Skills in their current incarnation won’t be paying the bills for Amazon any time soon. There’s a lot of potential for Google, Apple, Microsoft, or anyone else really, to come along and blow away the lead Amazon is said to have.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><summary type="html">Ever since Amazon released the Amazon Echo, there has been a growing market for “smart speakers” along with unique features for each.

A lot of people are quick to point to the Google Home or Amazon Echo devices and say how far ahead their assistant devices are compared to something like Apple’s Siri. This is a slightly unfair comparison, since Google Home and Amazon’s Echo (Alexa) assistants are using purpose-built hardware with an array of mics and always-plugged-in power. Line-powered mics will immediately give any assistant a major advantage in that it can be listening much better than on any battery-powered device like a phone or watch. Of course, this really only affects how the device hears a user and interprets their voice. That is only a small (but very important) part of the overall assistant experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Apple’s HomePod soon entering the market, we should have at least a more level playing field in terms of mic hardware to compare against. I expect we’ll see a reduction in the misinterpretation of commands with this, but as many are quick to point out, Siri still falls short of other assistants in terms of overall functionality. Essentially, the story goes that Google Home is way further ahead than the rest (which is not entirely false, but the gap may be perceived bigger than it really is), with Alexa and Siri being matched in many cases. This unfortunately is a bit of an over simplification, as there are plenty of things Alexa cannot do given the platform is limited to voice (no screen). People are quick to point out the vast array of third-party support Alexa has for “skills” and claim this is a huge advantage over Siri, but using any of these skills it’s pretty easy to see most of them aren’t very practical and serve mostly as a gimmick to demo Alexa. While it is a leg up over Siri, their API is very limited and won’t be revolutionizing the voice assistant industry any time soon (largely due to the complex nature of triggering these skills, lacking a good natural language parser).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Home has the obvious advantage of being connected to Google’s enormous stockpile of user data. If it weren’t the leader in this space, there would be reason for concern. This means it tends to understand commands better and can do a decent job at returning search results and trivia (even if they aren’t necessarily accurate due to the nature of Google’s popularity algorithm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s biggest advantage (and let’s be honest, the main purpose of the Echo) is the ability to sell you stuff. While it can handle minor trivia, it usually falls short. It has many of the other “standard” functions found in all modern assistants like timers, weather, news and calendars, but overall its skill set is pretty limited when you venture too far from the shopping aspect. Its command system is very rigid compared to that of Siri or Google, meaning you can’t use natural language to trigger things (well, you sort of can, but each app has to do its own parsing, which is rather inconsistent, not to mention triggers are still often unnatural). It has home automation, but it requires very precise wording to get even a limited set of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siri is the oldest assistant in terms of software, but for a variety of reasons can be limited in some of the spaces Google or Alexa are good at. It can search the web, but may not always return a direct answer, rather a search result. I would argue this is Apple’s typical way of erring on the side of caution, ensuring they don’t just assume the correct answer is the top result like Google does (and has often proven to be wrong, popular doesn’t mean accurate). It can’t shop for things, but that’s something they would need third-parties for (and I doubt Amazon is going to opt-in any time soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the grand scale, Siri has been able to do a lot of things for a while, with new features added all of the time, but many of these functions are now common place amongst assistants. Where I think Apple has the advantage with Siri is hardware. While the others have user data to benefit from and produce software results, Apple has been busy laying down a foundation of hardware that provides access to Siri. Whether Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, AirPods, Apple TV, Mac or HomePod (did I miss any?), there are a variety of ways and places you can access Siri. Whether you’re at home (HomePod), in the car (CarPlay), or walking around (Apple Watch/AirPods), Siri is always there ready to go. The other assistants are largely tethered to their assistant-in-a-can that stays home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re starting to see Alexa added to portable devices, but most of them are still pretty tethered. Google Assistant is of course available on the phone, Android Wear watches and the Pixel Buds, but the reviews for all but the phone have been pretty bad. This is where Apple has the advantage. They know hardware, they’ve been great at producing this stuff for a while now, and on top of that, can make Siri very accessible on the go. Siri may not be the most capable right now, but what good is any assistant if it’s not available when you need it? All it would take for Apple is to plop in a new “Siri 2.0” and suddenly they have a plethora of hardware that people already have and can use with it. Similar to their release of ARkit, overnight you would have a ton of users with access to this new assistant. The competition can make great AI, but what good is that if you can’t use it?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><summary type="html">Reading the comments on just about any post about voice assistants these days will quickly reveal a variety of opinions on each.

Whether it be that they just don’t find them useful or they never work right, every case tends to follow some common themes. Now, I don’t mean to pull a Steve Jobs with the old “you’re holding it wrong” type thing, but I would be willing to bet a lot of users simply aren’t using their assistants correctly in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Siri since the iPhone 4S, and not just as a gimmick but as a genuinely useful extension of my technology experience. When the 4S came out in 2011, Apple also added a new Reminders app to iOS, which happened to coincide with the newly-added Siri, which could set reminders. Before I upgraded to the 4S, I was loving the Reminders app already. It was a super handy way of ensuring I don’t forget things, or having geo-fences trigger when I enter or leave somewhere. The addition of Siri made this already-useful feature immensely more useful, as suddenly I didn’t need to unlock my phone, open Reminders, type it out, adjust the date/time/location, etc. I could just dictate the entire thing to Siri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assistants get a lot of flack, but overall if you just learn the interface even a little, it can go a long way. I certainly would love my assistant to do more, but it still makes my life easier in a lot of ways. The bonus is, the more you use it, the more it improves both in language parsing and understanding you. Perhaps not directly, but this data can at least improve the assistant over time by the company knowing how users are interacting and what results they are getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, while assistants have been useful to me, I’ve been a nerd about keeping up with each new function they’ve added to Siri. Part of the problem with many of these assistants is that it’s not always obvious what they can and can’t do. Much like the frustrations users experience with poor user interface and experience in traditional software GUIs, the same could be said of assistants. Users expect one thing but may get a different result, or nothing at all. This is where truly intelligent assistants will greatly improve things, but we’re not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aaron Dippner</name></author><summary type="html">From time to time I hear a lot of complaints from people about voice assistants.
